          <p> </p>
           <p>Why do masters find the good moves that patzers overlook? How has chess evolved from the
            historical times till now? A number of books are written to fully comprehend the dynamics of chess.
            Some of these insights can be quite surprising but are instrumental in demistifying 
            the concept. This is basically a beginner's tour into the whole concept of online Chess.
            <br>
            <h2>Chess</h2>
            <p> In the present day, Chess is has been made accessible to a larger percentage of the world population
              This fete has been achieved through the use of mobile application
              This to me is the beauty of technology. One such application is Lichess App. Once one downloads the Chess app they 
              get access to a virtual chess board that they can learn from. With time, they feel free to engage with 
              the vast community of chess gamers. Any day, any time chess players use the app, they get paired with 
              a partner whom they can have a battle of the mind with.It has become normal for anyone with the passion to
            practice from being a beginner to being a chess master at the comfort of their phones.  </p>

              <p> A whole collection of movies have produced to showcase the lives of chess players and masters.
              one such movie is the Queen's Gambit which showcases the passion and Grit that accompanies chess
              . The enthusiasm and the practise. This just goes to tell that for one to grow from a beginner to 
            an intermediate to an expert and finaly a master, they have to put in the work and effort. Chess is a skill
          and like other skills, it has to be cultivated. </p>

      <h2>Chess Pieces</h2>
        <p>
          <h3>The King</h3>
          <p>The whole set consist of two kings of different colors.
            The aim of the game is to keep the king from getting trapped with no escape square. 
            A position called check mate. Every other piece has an allegience to protect the king,
             else, the game is lost to the opponent.
             The king moves one square in any direction except when castling where it moves two steps to either right
              or left depending on the chosen castle side.
             </p>
          <h3>The Queen</h3>
          <p> This is the most powerful piece on the board. It moves in both diagonal and horizontal directions
            as long as there is no obstacle on the path. It captures any opposing piece on its path.
          </p>
          <h3>The Bishop</h3>
          <p> The bishop moves in a diagonal path punishing any oppossing piece in its path by capturing them</p>
          <h3>The Rook</h3>
          <p> This piece takes a invasive and deadly approach. It moves in a horizontal path from the square it resides on
            There being two rooks, it is advisable to align your rooks so as to form a formidable defence/attack
             structure
          </p>
          <h3>The Knight</h3>
          <p>The Knight takes a subtle yet lethal strategy. Moving by skipping two squares and settling on the 
            next square
          </p>
          <h3>The Pawn</h3>
          <p>The pawn is definitely the most restricted piece in movement. It can move forward two steps
            in its first move after which it moves forward only once. However, when strategically placed on the 
            board, the pawns can be your best guardians or attackers.

            more attack impact. </p>
